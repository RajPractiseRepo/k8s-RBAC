# Kubernetes RBAC Setup Guide:
This Repo provides instructions for setting up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for users and namespaces in a Kubernetes cluster.

# Why Use RBAC?

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is crucial for managing permissions and ensuring security within a Kubernetes cluster. It allows you to: 


•	**Control Access**: Define who can access specific resources and what actions they can perform. This is essential for enforcing security policies and preventing unauthorized access. \
•	**Segregate Duties**: Assign different roles to users based on their responsibilities. For instance, some users might only need read access, while others require full administrative privileges. \
•	**Enhance Security**: Minimize the risk of accidental or malicious actions by limiting user permissions to only what is necessary for their role. \
•	**Simplify Management**: Manage permissions at a granular level, making it easier to oversee and adjust access as needed.


# Components of Kubernetes RBAC:

1.	**Roles**: A Role is a set of rules that define a set of permissions within a specific namespace. It can be used to grant or restrict access to API objects such as pods, services, deployments, and more. Roles are specific to a namespace and cannot be used across namespaces.
2.	**ClusterRoles**: Similar to Roles, ClusterRoles are a set of rules that define permissions, but they are not namespace-specific. ClusterRoles can be used to grant or restrict access to resources that span across multiple namespaces or the entire cluster.
3.	**RoleBinding**s: A RoleBinding binds a Role or ClusterRole to one or more users, groups, or service accounts. It establishes a connection between a set of permissions defined in a Role/ClusterRole and the entities that should have those permissions.
4.	**ClusterRoleBindings**: Just like RoleBindings, ClusterRoleBindings bind ClusterRoles to users, groups, or service accounts. However, ClusterRoleBindings apply the permissions across the entire cluster, rather than being limited to a specific namespace.


# Here’s an example to illustrate how Kubernetes RBAC can be implemented:

Let’s say we have a Kubernetes cluster with multiple namespaces **dev and qa**, and we want to configure RBAC to provide different levels of access to different teams within our organization.

# 1. Define Roles: 
We start by defining Roles that specify the permissions required by each team. For instance, we might create two Roles: “developer” and “qa.”

The “developer” Role might have permissions to create and manage deployments, services, and pods within a specific namespace. The YAML definition for the “developer” Role could look like this:


```bash
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: dev
  name: developer-role
rules:
- apiGroups: ["", "extensions", "apps"]
  resources: ["deployments", "services", "pods"]
  verbs: ["create", "get", "update", "delete", "list", "watch"]
```


Similarly, the “qa” Role might have permissions to manage persistent volumes, secrets, and config maps within the qa namespace:
```bash
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: qa
  name: qa-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["persistentvolumes", "secrets", "configmaps"]
  verbs: ["create", "get", "update", "delete", "list", "watch"]
```

# 2. Create RoleBindings: 

Next, we need to create RoleBindings to associate these Roles with the appropriate users, groups, or service accounts. For example, let’s create a RoleBinding that assigns the “developer” Role to the specific user "dev-user" within the “dev” namespace:

```bash
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: dev
  name: developer-rolebinding
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: dev-user
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: developer-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```


Similarly, we can create a RoleBinding that assigns the “qa” Role to a specific user named “qa-user” within the "qa" namespace:

```bash
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: qa
  name: qa-rolebinding
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: qa-user
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: qa-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```


# 3. Applying the RBAC Configuration:

Once the Roles and RoleBindings are defined, you can apply the RBAC configuration using the kubectl apply command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f dev-role.yaml
kubectl apply -f qa-role.yaml
kubectl apply -f dev-rolebinding.yaml
kubectl apply -f qa-rolebinding.yaml
```

 
 After applying these configurations, the “dev-user” will have the permissions defined in the “dev” Role, and the “qa-user” will have the permissions defined in the “qa-role” Role within the “dev and qa” namespace respectively.

This example showcases how RBAC can be used to grant specific permissions to different teams or individuals within a Kubernetes cluster. By combining Roles and RoleBindings, you can define and enforce access control policies that align with your organization’s requirements. Remember to regularly review and update your RBAC configurations as your cluster evolves and new access requirements arise.


# Conclusion:

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a vital component of securing your Kubernetes cluster. By implementing RBAC, you can control access to various resources and enforce fine-grained permissions. Understanding the components of RBAC and following best practices will help you design robust access control policies that align with your organization’s security requirements. With RBAC, you can strike the balance between granting the necessary privileges and maintaining the integrity and security of your Kubernetes environment.
